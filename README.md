# Overview

The app also offers a way to search for your fish profiles and even delete or edit the entries. You are able to see all the details on the fishes profile page along with a catch section where you are able to log data about the catches you have made of that particular type of fish. The local date and time are inputted along with different types of details about the catch and also an image (if you want). You are also able to edit and delete the catch data of each individual fish.
